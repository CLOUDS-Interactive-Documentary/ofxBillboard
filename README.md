ofxBillboard
=====================================

Introduction
------------
An old-school billboarding addon. I know openFrameworks comes with awesome `GL_POINTS` billboard examples, but sometimes you need to do it without using shaders.

Installation
------------
Just drop the `ofxBillboard` folder into `openFrameworks/addons/`.

Compatibility
------------
Tested with openFrameworks 0.7.4.
